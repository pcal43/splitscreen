# Splitscreen Support

Simple mod that makes it easier to position windows for local multiplayer.

With this mod installed, hitting the 'Toggle Fullscreen' button (F11) will cycle you through different half- and quarter-size
window positions for split screen play.  It then saves your choice and brings the window up in the same place when you
restart the game. 

This makes it easier for you to start two or more copies of Minecraft and have the windows be positioned automatically 
for splitscreen.

## Suggested Setup 

### Stuff you need
* Two or more copies of minecraft
* [PrismLauncher](https://prismlauncher.org/)
* [Midnight Controls](https://modrinth.com/mod/midnightcontrols)
* [Splitscreen Support](https://modrinth.com/mod/splitscreen)
* Two or more gamepads
* One or more friends
* One big TV hooked up to your computer
* One couch

### What to do
* Create two or more minecraft instances in PrismLauncher, one for each account
* In each instance, install SplitScreen Support and MidnightControls
* Launch each of the instances and configure them 
  * Hit F11 to get the screens aligned in each one
  * Get a gamepad for each instance and configure MidnightControls
* In one of the instances, create a new world and 'Open to LAN'
* Connect the other instances to that one (e.g., localhost:25565)
* Get your friends and have a Minecraft party!

## Other mod features
* Username is displayed in the upper-left corner of the main menu (so you can tell who's who)

## Adjusting the gap between windows
By default, the mod puts a small gap between windows.  You can change the width of this gap
(or make it `0`) by setting the value of the `gap` property in `config/splitscreen.properties`.
(This file doesn't exist until you quit minecraft for the first time with the mod running).
