# Splitscreen Support

Simple mod that makes it easier to position windows for local multiplayer.

With this mod installed, hitting the 'Toggle Fullscreen' button (F11) will cycle you through different window positions for split screen play:

* Top half of screen, no border
* Bottom half...
* Left...
* Right
* Top-Left
* Top-Right
* Bottom-Left
* Bottom-Right
* Normal Windowed
* Full Screen

It saves your choice and brings the window up in the same place when your restart the game.  This makes it easier for
you to start two or more copies of Minecraft and have the windows be positioned automatically for splitscreen.
